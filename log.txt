This game should be strictly turn-based. Synchronization is easier this way.  -- Jiaqi

We should modularize the game as soon as possible, so that people can work simotinuously without interference.  -- Jiaqi

Some ideas about modularizing the game:
  GUI
  Images and Soundtracks
  Game Design
  core mechanics
  Management amoung different modules
       -- Jiaqi

Jan 26 Meeting Update:
  Core Mechanics
  Map (generator/static?)
  Interface (I/O) menu, etc
  AI (AI and human inherit from player)
  Network Play
  Files (save maps, game state)
  Game art
  Grid-based
  Turn based
  Create UML diagram for classes
  No game engine as of yet?
