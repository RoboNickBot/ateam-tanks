I think it would be a good idea to have this document to start throwing ideas around.  We can also organize things and start creating some structure to the project. We can also finalize ideas where everyone can see them at any time.

Some things I think we need to finalize:
     - Rules of the game
     - Graphic interface we are going to use
       	 - So we can all learn about it on our own
     - I think we need to finalize all the general things as soon as possible so we can just have things to start working on
