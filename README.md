Tank Battles!
=============

A yet-to-be-officially-named 2D multiplayer tank combat game which could feature
AI enemies,
music and sound effects,
network play,
explosion physics,
and anything else we come up with!

We are writing the game as a desktop application in Java and
a not-yet-chosen media framework (likely SDL).
